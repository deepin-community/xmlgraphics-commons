Description: Reusable components used by Batik and FOP
 Apache XML Graphics Commons is a library that consists of several
 reusable components used by Apache Batik and Apache FOP. Many of these
 components can easily be used separately outside the domains of SVG and
 XSL-FO. You will find components such as a PDF library, an RTF library,
 Graphics2D implementations that let you generate PDF & PostScript
 files, and much more.
